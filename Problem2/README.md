## üß† Overview

This project is the **Problem2** folder inside the `99tech` repository.  
It is a small **React + TypeScript + Vite** application that focuses on implementing a clean, maintainable UI using **MUI**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Emotion**.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:
- Modular component-based UI design.
- Type-safe implementation with TypeScript.
- Responsive and consistent layout using MUI and TailwindCSS.
- Proper build and deployment setup for GitHub Pages.

## üí° Implementation Details

- **UI Design:**  
  The layout and components are implemented using a mix of **MUI** and **TailwindCSS**, providing both flexibility and clean visual hierarchy.

- **Component Logic:**  
  Each component handles its own state using React‚Äôs built-in hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), focusing on clarity and maintainability.  
  There is **no external state management** or complex global store ‚Äî the architecture remains simple and easy to follow.

- **Styling Approach:**  
  - TailwindCSS handles the general layout and spacing.  
  - Emotion is used for cases requiring dynamic or conditional styling.  
  - MUI components ensure accessibility and design consistency.

- **TypeScript Integration:**  
  Types are defined for component props and function parameters to ensure safe and predictable code behavior.

- **Code Style:**  
  ESLint and TypeScript are configured to maintain a consistent coding standard and catch potential issues early.

- **Date & Data Handling:**  
  - `dayjs` is used for date formatting and manipulation.  
  - `axios` is integrated for handling HTTP requests (ready for API connection).
